# Pre-Fab UI Libraries

If the project uses a pre-built UI Library (like [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)), then the variables and mixins included are available for use in the SCSS files. Core library functionality should be overridden, never modified. SCSS variables should be kept in `sass/_variables.scss`.
